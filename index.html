              <p class="subDetails">March 2017</p>
              <p>Worked together as a team to come up with a Telegram bot that could aid users in getting to their social meetups. Information is extracted using the Meetup API, tied in the use of Watson Conversation and Node-Red to prototype a 'friendly' bot that reminds users of their appointments and gets them there. The bot will remind users and annoy users till they respond so that they do not forget about their appointments. In addition, the bot will bring up google maps to direct users in the event when they are lost. This project is done within 24 hours.</p>

              <p>Create a test station (hardware and software) to accurately identify the fault in one of the PCB board located in a secondary power supply unit on an aircraft. The project involves understanding the schematic drawing of the PCB board, identify the important test points and designing a software interface to automate the test. This project allows ST aerospace to identify and replace the faulty component instead of replacing the whole board. Hence achieving cost cutting.    </p>
